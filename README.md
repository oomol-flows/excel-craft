# DataCraft - Smart Table Processing Toolkit

Work with your spreadsheets and data files more efficiently with this comprehensive collection of easy-to-use tools.

## What is DataCraft?

DataCraft is a visual toolkit that helps you work with spreadsheet files (Excel, CSV, and TSV) without needing to write code or use complex software. Whether you're cleaning up messy data, analyzing sales reports, or preparing information for presentations, DataCraft provides simple building blocks that you can connect together to get the job done.

Think of it like LEGO blocks for your data - each tool does one specific job really well, and you can combine them in different ways to accomplish exactly what you need.

## Who is This For?

- **Business professionals** who work with Excel files and want to automate repetitive tasks
- **Data analysts** who need to clean and prepare data quickly
- **Anyone** who wants to work with spreadsheets more efficiently without learning programming

## What Can You Do With DataCraft?

### Read and Import Your Files
Start by bringing in your data from Excel spreadsheets, CSV files, or tab-separated text files. The tool automatically detects what type of file you have and reads it correctly.

### Understand Your Data
Get a quick overview of what's in your spreadsheet - how many rows and columns, what type of information each column contains, and identify any missing or problematic data.

### Clean Up Messy Data
Fix common data problems like:
- Remove empty rows or fill in missing values
- Delete duplicate entries
- Fix text formatting issues (extra spaces, inconsistent capitalization)
- Convert data to the right format (dates, numbers, text)

### Filter and Sort
Focus on exactly what you need by:
- Showing only rows that meet certain criteria
- Selecting specific columns to work with
- Sorting information in ascending or descending order
- Breaking large datasets into smaller, manageable chunks

### Transform and Enhance
Create new information from your existing data:
- Add new columns with calculated values
- Split one column into multiple (like separating first and last names)
- Combine columns together
- Rename columns for clarity

### Analyze and Summarize
Get insights from your data:
- Group information by categories (like sales by region or month)
- Calculate totals, averages, counts, and other statistics
- Create pivot tables to see patterns
- Perform time-based analysis on date ranges

### Validate Quality
Make sure your data meets your requirements:
- Check for required fields
- Verify data is within expected ranges
- Ensure formatting follows rules
- Identify and flag problems

### Join Multiple Files
Combine information from different spreadsheets:
- Match rows from two files based on common columns
- Merge related information side-by-side
- Support for different types of joins (keep all rows, only matching rows, etc.)

### Sample and Split
Work with portions of your data:
- Take random samples for testing
- Split data into training and testing sets
- Extract representative subsets from large files

### Work With Time-Based Data
Handle date and time information:
- Convert between time zones
- Extract specific parts (year, month, day)
- Calculate differences between dates
- Create time-based groupings

### Apply Formulas
Use familiar spreadsheet-like formulas to calculate new values without needing to understand programming.

### Format Output
Control exactly how your results look when exported back to Excel or CSV files.

## How Does It Work?

1. **Choose Your Starting Point**: Begin by reading your data file
2. **Add Processing Steps**: Connect tools together in the order you want them to run
3. **See Results Instantly**: Watch your data transform at each step with visual previews
4. **Export When Ready**: Save your processed data in the format you need

Each step in your workflow is shown visually, making it easy to understand what's happening and make adjustments.

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Clean Up a Customer List
Start with a messy customer database → Remove duplicate entries → Fill in missing phone numbers → Fix text formatting → Sort by last name → Export to Excel

### Example 2: Analyze Sales Data
Import sales report → Filter to show only last quarter → Group by sales region → Calculate total sales and customer counts for each region → Create summary report

### Example 3: Prepare Data for Presentation
Read multiple data files → Combine them together → Select only the columns you need → Sort by importance → Remove any incomplete records → Export as formatted Excel file
